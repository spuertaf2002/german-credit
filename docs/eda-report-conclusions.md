## Some conclusions
1. Indeed, as alerted in the report credit duration was highly correlated with the credit amount, depicting a clear trend where the credit lasted longer for more expensive credit amounts.
2. The report showed a high correlation between Saving accounts and Credit amounts, this correlation couldn't be confirmed by the [EDA](https://github.com/spuertaf2002/german-credit/blob/f0ea4c8aa129696c6d2dea51f4edca367d4df6b0/notebooks/eda.ipynb) performed.
